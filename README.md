# MILS - Eye-tracking
 
GitHub repo of the Eye-tracking module of the Methods in Language Sciences Summer School 2024 offered by UGent, maintained by @erbadaya and @marbaltais.

‚ùì What is each folder?

1. Articles

In this folder, you can find a folder for each day of the summer school (references-dayX). Within each, there is a README file with the entire list of references (the same list that you can find in the slides) and some (and in some cases, all) of the articles referred to. Additionally, there are four folders for additional literature on the eye-tracking technique,  Visual World Paradigm, and reading, as well as software manuals.

2. Experimental scripts

Part of this module's goal is to give you a hands-down training with eye-tracking experiments. This also means building an experiment! In this folder, you can find the scripts we will walk you through in class, divided in VWP and reading. These scripts are built in OpenSesame. Additionally, there is a detailed Walkthrough for each script (except for a more Python-esque code for the VWP).

3. Resources

You can find a README file with links to different databases for stimuli.

4. Slides

Here you can find the .qmd files used to create the slides. These slides are made on Quarto. We have used the clean template by Grant McDermott and Kyle Butts (see here: https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean/tree/main) with a few edits. Section heads on the slide are from Megan Hall (see here: https://meghan.rbind.io/blog/quarto-slides/). **We recommend you download the .pdf files**, unless you want to download all the dependencies (which are stored in the 'quarto-slides' folder).

5. Software

In this folder, you can find the links (or .exe files) for the software used in class (namely, OpenSesame and DataViewer, although R and R Studio are recommended too). 


Whenever you use any of the materials in these folders, please give credit.
