This folder contains template scripts for a VWP and a single sentence reading eye-tracking experiments, implemented in PsychoPy (version 2022) and Experiment Builder (version X). Note that in the course, we will be working with PsychoPy -- assuming no coding experience, so we will work you through the code. These scripts have been developed by Esperanza Badaya (PsychoPy) and Mariia Baltais (Experiment Builder) and are under a Creative Commons license. Were you to use them for your personal use, please refer to us.
