 How to navigate this repository?

 > Slides

    - Here you can find the .qmd files used to create the slides (which you can find on Ufora). These slides are made on Quarto. We have used the clean template by Grant McDermott and Kyle Butts (see here: https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean/tree/main) with a few edits. Section heads on the slide are from Megan Hall (see here: https://meghan.rbind.io/blog/quarto-slides/). This also means that the .pdf version is not ideal (to be read as they do not look as nice as they do when presented).
    -There are also folders with the images used in session's slides.

> Readings

    - Although you can find the references at the end of the presentation each day, we have additionally uploaded (most of) the articles here. You can find them in their respective folder.

> Experimental scripts

    - Part of this module's goal is to give you a hands-down training with eye-tracking experiments. This also means building an experiment!
    - In this folder, you can find the scripts we will walk you through in class, divided in VWP and reading. These scripts are built in PsychoPy and Experiment Builder.

> Analysis scripts

    - Here you can find examples of how to pre-process, visualize and analyse your data.

Whenever you use any of the materials in this folder, please give appropriate credit.
