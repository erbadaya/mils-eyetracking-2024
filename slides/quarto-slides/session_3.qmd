# What's special about reading

## Reading research in a nutshell

We have a wealth of **paradigms** to explore how individuals comprehend a piece of written text (from words to multiple sentences, created stimuli or real texts), considering both **low-level processes** for word identification (e.g., lexical access) and **higher-level processes** for sentence and discourse comprehension (e.g., inferences).

## Reading is a skill

-   Reading is relatively new
    -   Homo Sapiens $\pm$ 300.000 BC
    -   Sumerian pictographic writing $\pm$ 3.300 BC
    -   Phoenician alphabetic language $\pm$ 2.000 BC
-   Exposure, practice, formal instruction
    -   We are good at it ($\pm$ 250 WPM; Brysbaert, 2019)
    -   Linked to academic achievement, late L2 acquisition

## History

-   Javal (1879)

    -   Reading is not smooth

-   Mid-70s: Technological advances

-   Rayner's work

    -   Clifton et al., 2016: "Eye movements in reading and information processing: Keith Rayner's 40 year legacy"

## Some general facts

-   Most people are good at reading, but there are individual differences (e.g., reading proficiency, L1 vs. L2...)
-   There seems to be some immediacy[^1] when comprehending a text, but we also get ahead of ourselves
-   In contrast to spoken language, people can go back when they encounter a difficulty, and indeed they do

[^1]: Cf. linking hypothesis; serial vs. parallel processing debate.

## Eye movements in reading

Human Visual System (recap):

-   **Fovea**: highest visual acuity
-   **Parafovea**: still partial recognition of objects
-   **Periphery**: blurred image

**Fixations** vs. **saccades**: movements (saccades) that place objects on the fovea for processing (fixations).

## Eye movements in reading

How does this work in reading?

-   A priori: Our eyes move, so that objects (words?) are placed on the fovea and can be processed.

...but this is not exactly so.

## Eye movements in reading

![From Conklin et al., 2018](images/session_3/perceptual_span_reading.JPG){fig-align="center" width="590"}

## Eye movements in reading

-   Fovea does not equate the perceptual span (= effective visual field)
-   Reading is asymmetric = asymmetric extraction of information
    -   Bias towards the direction of reading in the language
    -   English: 3-4[^2] letter spaces (1 degree of visual angle) to the left, 14-15 ls to the right

[^2]: Depends on print size, of course.

## Eye movements in reading

Fixations

-   Mean duration (silent reading in English): 200 - 250 ms
-   Lexical access initiated at about 100 ms (Sereno & Rayner, 2003)
-   Optimal Viewing Position
-   Most reading measures are based on fixation durations
-   Affected by word length, frequency, predictability, etc.

![Data from Mariia Baltais](images/session_3/mariia_fix.JPG){fig-align="center" width="500"}

::: notes
The Optimal Viewing Position (OVP) effect shows that word identification is best when the eyes first fixate near the center of words. When words are presented for short durations, recognition performance is maximal when the viewing position is slightly left of the word center.
:::

## Eye movements in reading

Saccades

-   Saccadic supression
-   Saccadic latency (about 200 ms)
-   Mean size (silent reading in English): 7 to 9 letter spaces ($\pm$ 2 words before or after the fixated word)
    -   Size: distance travelled (amplitude)
-   Not analyzed except for backward saccades (regressions)

![Data from Mariia Baltais](images/session_3/mariia_sac.JPG){fig-align="center" width="500"}

::: notes
Saccadic suppression refers to the behavioral observation that healthy humans under normal circumstances do not perceive this motion.

Saccadic latency (150-250 ms): time needed to program and launch a saccade. This latency period includes the time required for the brain to process visual information, make a decision about where to move the eyes next, and initiate the eye movement.
:::

## Eye movements in reading

Regressions

-   10-15% of the saccades are regressions to preceding areas
    -   To correct 'overshooting'
    -   Processing difficulty

![Data from Mariia Baltais](images/session_3/mariia_sac.JPG){fig-align="center" width="500"}

## Eye movements in reading

![](images/session_3/skipping.JPG){fig-align="center"}

## Eye movements in reading

Skipping

-   70% of the words in a text are fixated
-   Content words are fixated 85% of the time, function words 35% of the time
-   Predictors: word length; also predictability, frequency, etc.
    -   Parafoveal processing!
-   Overshooting or processing ease

## Eye movements in reading

Blinking

-   Noise
    -   Day 4, data pre-processing

![Data from Mariia Baltais](images/session_3/mariia_blink.JPG){fig-align="center" width="500"}

## Linking hypothesis

Fixations, regressions, skipping -\> wide range of measures.

Reading (during a fixation) entails the use of visual, orthographic, phonological, and morphological information to:

-   Identify a word
-   Activate its lexical representation
-   Integrate with the preceding context
-   Predict what's next?

## Linking hypothesis

Just and Carpenter's (1980) eye-mind hypothesis (recap):

-   What we look at = what we are processing

    -   Extends beyond linguistic processing (visual attention)

Just and Carpenter's (1980) immediacy hypothesis:

-   Readers try to interpret each content word as it is encountered

    -   As soon as possible, without delay

And,

-   For how long we look = how difficult it is to process

::: notes
From J&C:

Gaze durations reflect the time to execute comprehension processes. Longer fixations are attributed to longer processing caused by the word's infrequency and its thematic importance.

The model of reading comprehension proposes that readers interpret a word while they are fixating it, and they continue to fixate it until they have processed it as far as they can.

The link between eye fixation data and the theory rests on two assumptions. One is the eye-mind assumption: **the eye remains fixated on a word as long as the word is being processed**. The eye-mind assumption posits that there is no appreciable lag between what is being fixated and what is being processed.

The immediacy assumption: a reader tries to interpret each content word of a text as it is encountered, even at the expense of making guesses that sometimes turn out to be wrong. The immediacy assumption posits that the interpretations at all levels of processing are not deferred; they occur as soon as possible.

The immediacy assumption posits that an attempt to relate each content word to its referent occurs as soon as possible. Sometimes this can be done when the word is first fixated, but sometimes more information is required. For example, although the semantic interpretation of a relative adjective like large can be computed immediately, the extensive meaning depends on the word it modifies (e.g., large insect vs. large building). The referent of the entire noun phrase can be computed only after both words are processed. The immediacy assumption does not state that the relating is done immediately on each content word, but rather that it occurs as soon as possible.
:::

## Linking hypothesis

The more difficult the text...

-   The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the fixation durations
-   The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the saccade sizes
-   The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the regressions
-   The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the skipping of words

## Linking hypothesis

The more difficult the text...

-   The longer the fixation durations
-   The smaller the saccade sizes
-   The more frequent the regressions
-   The less frequent the skipping of words

## Linking hypothesis

-   "Strong" eye-mind hypothesis: readers fixate a word until it's processed as far as possible

    -   Morrison, 1984: completion of lexical access on word *n* -\> immediate shift in attention & planning a saccade to word *n+1*

    -   Boland, 2004: the eyes do not leave a word until it has been *structurally* integrated

::: notes
Boland, 2004: The eyes do not leave a word until it has been structurally integrated. Therefore, **constraints that control structure-building influence first-pass reading time**.
:::

## Linking hypothesis

-   Too strong?

    -   Pickering et al. (2004): some aspects of processing take more time than the eye is “prepared to wait”

    -   Mitchell et al. (2008): regressions are not only linguistically supervised

::: notes
Pickering et al. (2004): some aspects of lexical, syntactic, and semantic processing do (largely) respect the immediacy and eye-mind assumptions (with some important caveats), but that **many aspects of sentence interpretation are somewhat delayed**. Semantic processing may not all occur “at once” (readers do look at difficult words such as Finland - in "A lot of Americans protested during Finland", - but they largely do this during later processing rather than during first pass).

Mitchell et al. (2008): the purpose of regressive fixations (and, indeed, re-fixations on the same word) is not to refresh the evidence but merely a delaying tactic used to provide "time out" for as-yet-incomplete parsing operations (to postpone new input). Linguistic and other forms of eye-movement control are rather loosely-, not tightly-coupled.
:::

## Linking hypothesis

Asymmetrical perceptual span:

-   **Preview benefit**: some info about *n+1* while still on *n* -\> shorter reading times *n+1*
    -   Lexical processing can start before a word is fixated
-   **Parafoveal-on-foveal effects**: characteristics of *n+1* influence reading times for *n*
    -   Mixed findings, see Table 4.1 in Conklin et al., 2018 (p. 83)

## Linking hypothesis

As well as

-   **Spillover effects**: characteristics of *n* influence reading times for *n+1*
    -   Processing has not been completed

Therefore,

-   Serial vs. parallel processing debate

    -   Different models of reading (E-Z Reader vs. SWIFT; OB1-Reader)

::: notes
Serial: words are processed one at a time in a linear sequence. E-Z: eee-zee (easy).

Parallel: words are processed simultaneously. The cognitive system processes information from several words at once, allowing for faster and more efficient reading. Attention is distributed dynamically across several words, with a gradient of attention decreasing from the point of fixation outward. SWIFT: Saccade-Generation with Inhibition by Foveal Targets. The word currently fixated (the foveal target) inhibits the generation of saccades. This inhibition ensures that the word is sufficiently processed before the eyes move to the next word. Once a threshold of processing is reached, the inhibition decreases, allowing for the initiation of the next saccade. The SWIFT model emphasizes parallel processing and dynamic attention distribution, while the E-Z Reader model focuses on serial processing with some degree of parafoveal preview.

The OB1-Reader model (upgrade of E-Z?) incorporates both serial and parallel processing components: Optimal Viewing Position-Based Reading.
:::

# Measures

## Measures

Fixations, regressions, and skipping form multiple reading measures that arguably tap into different cognitive processes.

-   **Global** vs. **local** measures
    -   Overall reading behaviour vs. smaller units of text
-   Local measures: **early** (vs. **intermediate**) vs. **late** (see also Clifton et al., 2007)

## Measures

Reading measures \<-\> specific cognitive events?

No agreement on **linking**: it depends on researchers' theoretical assumptions (Boland, 2004).

Traditionally,

-   **Early measures**: highly automatic word *recognition* and lexical access processes
-   **Late measures**: more conscious, controlled, strategic processes, such as syntactic and semantic *integration*

NB: Different types of linguistic manipulations (e.g., lexical vs. syntactic) can produce effects in the same reading measures, so it's conventional to report both early and late measures.

## Early measures

First-pass measures (before moving to *n+1*):

-   **First fixation duration, single fixation duration, gaze duration (= first-pass reading time = first-run dwell time)**: time spent on an IA
-   **Skipping rate**: % trials where the IA was skipped on first pass
-   Influenced by length, frequency, predictability, etc.

::: notes
Clifton et al., 2007:

Skipping: length, predictability. FFD: earliest point to observe an effect due to properties of a word, e.g., frequency. GD: sensitive to semantic and syntactic anomalies.
:::

## Early measures

::: {r-stack}
![](images/session_3/earlymeasures.jpg){fig-align="center" width="900"}
:::

-   First fixation duration: 3
-   Single fixation duration: NA (two first-pass fixations)
-   Gaze duration: 3+4
-   Skipping: no (IA wasn't skipped in this trial)

## Intermediate measures

-   **Regression-path duration (= go-past time)**: time on *n*, *n-1*, etc., before moving to *n+1*
-   **(First-pass) regressions-out rate**: % trials where there was a regression out of the IA
-   Lexical and integration difficulties

::: notes
Clifton et al., 2007:

RPD: lexical and integration difficulties. Regr-out: difficulties in higher-level processing (e.g., discourse processing) of a text.
:::

## Intermediate measures

::: {r-stack}
![](images/session_3/earlymeasures.jpg){fig-align="center" width="900"}
:::

-   Regression-path duration: 3+4+5+6
-   First-pass regressions-out: yes (between fix 4 and 5)

## Late measures

-   **Re-reading time, second-pass reading time**: different definitions across literature
-   **Regressions-in rate**: % trials where there was a regression back into the IA
    -   Re-analysis, integration difficulties
-   **Total reading time (= dwell time)**: sum of all fixations
-   **Fixation count**
    -   Could be early and/or late processing effects

::: notes
Clifton et al., 2007:

Re-reading time (RPD-GD): indication of the time spent resolving a problem. TRT: impacted by both early and late processing. Effect in TRT but not in early measures -\> late effect on processing.
:::

## Late measures

::: {r-stack}
![](images/session_3/earlymeasures.jpg){fig-align="center" width="900"}
:::

-   Re-reading time: 5+6 (= regression-path duration - gaze duration)
-   Second-pass reading time: 6+9 (= total reading time - gaze duration)
-   Regressions-in: yes (between fix 8 and 9)
-   Total reading time: 3+4+6+9
-   Fixation count: four fix

## Measures

Measures are dependent on each other:

-   First fixation duration $\subseteq$ gaze duration $\subseteq$ total reading time, etc.
-   Late measures are cumulative
-   No transparent mapping measures \<-\> cognitive events!

Therefore,

-   An effect must be visible in \> 1 measure
-   Analysis: correction for multiple comparisons

# Paradigms in reading research

## Paradigms

Differ in ecological validity.

-   Gaze-contigent paradigms: eye gaze determines changes in the text display
-   Reading of experimental stimuli
-   Reading of natural text

## Disappearing text paradigm

Liversedge et al., 2004

-   IA: Disappears after having been fixated for a certain time.
-   Shows: Parafoveal + foveal processing.
-   IV: Time to disappear.
    -   Amount of visual exposure necessary for word recognition.

## Disappearing text paradigm

<br>

{{< video images/session_3/disappearing_text_animation.mp4>}}

## Fast priming paradigm

Sereno & Rayner, 1992

-   IA: First there is a prime in the target location. After the target location has been fixated for some time, the target word appears.
-   Shows: Priming effect (facilitation).
-   IV: Relationship prime and target.

## Fast priming paradigm

<br>

{{< video images/session_3/fast_priming_paradigm.mp4>}}

## Moving window paradigm

McConkie & Rayner, 1975

-   IA: Mask everything that's not fixated.
-   Shows: Parafoveal processing and perceptual span (extraction and use of information).
-   IV: Size of the window.

::: notes
By varying the size of the window and the type of mask (e.g., X's, visually similar or dissimilar characters) and comparing the reading times in the window and normal reading conditions, it is possible to define the size of the area from which a reader can efficiently extract and utilize information.
:::

## Moving window paradigm

<br>

{{< video images/session_3/moving_window.mp4>}}

## Foveal mask

Rayner & Bertera, 1979

-   IA: Mask what's fixated.
-   Shows: Parafoveal processing and perceptual span.
-   IV: Size of the window.

## Foveal mask

<br>

{{< video images/session_3/foveal_mask.mp4>}}

## Boundary paradigm

Rayner, 1975

Saccadic suppression.

-   IA: Masked and then changed to target word after the gaze crosses an invisible boundary.
-   Shows: Parafoveal processing and perceptual span.
    -   Preview effect (slowdown) / preview benefit when no mask in the control condition.
    -   Parafoveal-on-foveal effects (e.g., Drieghe, 2011).
-   IV: What information is extracted, e.g., visual similarity mask-target.

::: notes
The boundary paradigm (Rayner, 1975) makes use of the saccadic suppression. Saccadic suppression means that during a saccade the intake of visual information is suspended and the reader is practically blind. If a change in the visual environment is made during a saccade or very soon after the eyes have landed (\< 6 ms after the end of a saccade, McConkie & Loschky, 2002), the reader does not become consciously aware of it. The target word ("sentence" in the example of Table 7.1) is initially masked with a character string ("somkasoc"), and when the reader's eyes cross an invisible boundary in the text, the mask is replaced with the actual target word.

If the reader has extracted information from the target word preview prior to its change to the correct form, one should observe increased fixation time on the target word, even though the reader is not consciously aware of this. The size of the slowdown in eye fixation time, i.e. the difference between normal condition in which no change was made and a change condition is called the preview effect.

The preview benefit is simply computed as the difference in fixation time between a full preview condition, in which the target word was presented normally, and the preview condition.

Another measure to assess parafoveal processing is the so-called parafoveal-on-foveal effect (Kennedy, 2000). It measures the extent to which parafoveally available information affects fixation time on the previous word (Drieghe, 2011).

## Boundary paradigm

## Natural sentence reading (experimental stimuli)

Linguistic and non-linguistic factors affecting eye movement patterns in reading.

Usually, exploration of how patterns over an IA differ as a function of its properties.

Frazier & Rayner, 1982

Garden-path sentences: late closure vs. early closure.

## Natural text reading (constructed texts)

Pellicer-Sánchez, 2016

![From Conklin et al., 2018](images/session_3/texts_example.JPG){fig-align="center"}

## Natural text reading

GECO corpus (Cop et al., 2017)

-   The Mysterious Affair At Styles by Agatha Christie (1920)

![](images/session_3/geco.JPG)

Ecological validity but lack of control over text:

-   Participants' characteristics + matching samples
-   Control variables in statistical analysis

# Example: single sentence reading

## Single sentence reading experiment

Elements:

-   A sentence.

Trial sequence: Drift correction \> Visual presentation.

## Drift correction

Where the first word appears:

![](images/lab_setup/drift_reading.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Visual presentation

-   Time window of interest is from start to end (no triggers in between)
    -   Cf. gaze-contingent paradigms

## Visual presentation

Interest Areas:

![Data from Mariia Baltais](images/session_2/ia_reading.png)

## Interest Areas

-   Target region (*n*) but also
    -   Pre-critical region (*n-1*)
    -   Spillover region (*n+1*)

Size depends on the research question:

-   Single words, phrases, clauses...

## Interest Areas

Target (& spillover) IA:

-   Never beginning/end of the line
    -   1$^{st}$ and last fixations on a line are 5-7 ls from the edges
    -   1$^{st}$ word likely to be skipped
    -   1$^{st}$ fix longer, last fix shorter
-   Never clause-final
    -   Wrap-up effect

## Interest Areas

-   Vertically large enough
    -   Day 4, pre-processing: vertical drift correction

![Data from Mariia Baltais](images/session_3/mariia_verticaldrift.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

## Task

-   Move to the next trial (button press)
-   Comprehension questions (every now and then / every trial)

## Confounds

-   Characteristics of the visual presentation (non-linguistic)
-   Characteristics of the materials (linguistic)
-   Characteristics of the human visual system

## Non-linguistic confounds

Text layout:

-   Font style and size
    -   B&W is not recommended for dyslexic participants
    -   Monospace font (e.g., Courier)
    -   14-18 pt[^3] (3 letters = 1 degree)

[^3]: Depends on the distance to monitor.

::: notes
Conklin et al., 2018: a study with dyslexic participants might use pastel colours for the background to help reduce contrast levels.
:::

## Non-linguistic confounds

-   Margins
    -   Tracking less accurate at screen borders
-   Line breaks
    -   Readers under-/overshoot the first word

::: notes
Conklin et al., 2018: Aside from the problem of sentence wrap-up effects, fixations are not always stable when readers move from one line to the next, and often there is a tendency to under- or overshoot the target (the first word of the next line). Minor corrective saccades would influence reading times.
:::

## Non-linguistic confounds

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Line spacing[^4]
    -   Tracking less accurate for vertical movements (vertical drift)
    -   Double/triple spacing

[^4]: Less important for global measures (\> sentence-level processing).

## Linguistic confounds

See Clifton et al., 2016; Conklin et al., 2018 (Ch. 4):

-   **The Big Three** (Frequency, Length, Predictability)

As well as...

-   Familiarity, plausibility, prevalence, age of acquisition, lexical ambiguity, orthographic neighbourhood size, etc.

::: notes
Plausibility (real world knowledge). Prevalence (word knowledge in the population). Lexical ambiguity (number of word meanings). Orthographic neighbourhood size (neighbours differ by 1 letter).
:::

## HVS confounds

Foveal vs. parafoveal processing.

-   Sequential nature of reading.

-   Information from one area can influence eye movements in another area.

    -   Predictability, length, etc.
    -   Serial vs. parallel processing:
        -   Preview benefit, parafoveal-on-foveal effects (see Drieghe, 2011; Hyönä, 2011)
        -   Spillover effects

-   Match contexts!

## Exercise

Howard et al., 2017

1.  How did they define their Interest Areas?
2.  What factors should be considered for the antecedent? (i.e., *hammer/plunger* in the example)
3.  What information do you need from procedure and apparatus to replicate this study?

Let's take a break!

# Building a reading experiment

## Building a reading experiment

We are going to code an eye-tracking during reading experiment on OS.

-   Many of the things we learnt yesterday can be used today!
    -   Especially, we will use the same eye-tracking plug-ins

## Building a reading experiment

Example: high/low frequency words (Rayner & Duffy, 1986)

-   DVs: Fixations on an area of interest, regressions, skipping
-   IV: Word frequency

5 areas of interest in total

## Building a reading experiment

The constraints of the design:

-   We want to counterbalance participants across lists
-   We want participants to progress in the experiment by pressing the space bar
-   We want to show participants the instructions at the beginning of the experiment

## Building a reading experiment

The constraints of the eye tracker:

-   We want five areas of interest
-   We want a drift correction at the beginning of every trial
    -   Drift should appear where the sentence starts

## Building a reading experiment

The loop

-   Each row: a trial
-   What does the first row represent?
