This folder contains template scripts for a VWP and a single sentence reading eye-tracking experiments, implemented on OpenSesame (version 4.0.1).

If you are used to working on PsychoPy, please visit the [UGent eye-tracking repository](https://github.com/erbadaya/ugent-eyetracking) for examples. Likewise, SR Research provides templates for VWP and Reading built on Experiment Builder. If you want to explore those, you need to [register in the forum](https://www.sr-research.com/support/index.php)(your registration needs to be approved, so it is not immediate): You can find the templates [here](https://www.sr-research.com/support/showthread.php?tid=75), for example. Experiment Builder itself can also give you access to more templates.
