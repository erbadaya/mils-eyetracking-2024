# What's special about reading

## Reading research in a nutshell

We have a wealth of **paradigms** to explore how individuals comprehend a piece of written text (from words to multiple sentences, created stimuli or real texts), considering both **low-level processes** for word identification (e.g., lexical access) and **higher-level processes** for sentence and discourse comprehension (e.g., inferences).

## Reading is a skill

-   Reading is relatively new
    -   Homo Sapiens $\pm$ 300.000 BC
    -   Sumerian pictographic writing $\pm$ 3.300 BC
    -   Phoenician alphabetic language $\pm$ 2.000 BC
-   Exposure, practice, formal instruction
    -   We are good at it ($\pm$ 250 WPM; Brysbaert, 2019)
    -   Linked to academic achievement, late L2 acquisition

## History

-   Javal (1879)

    -   Reading is not smooth

-   Mid-70s: Technological advances

-   Rayner's work

    -   Clifton et al., 2016: "Eye movements in reading and information processing: Keith Rayner's 40 year legacy"

## Some general facts

-   Most people are good at reading, but there are individual differences (e.g., reading proficiency, L1 vs. L2...)
-   There seems to be some immediacy[^1] when comprehending a text, but we also get ahead of ourselves
-   In contrast to spoken language, people can go back when they encounter a difficulty, and indeed they do

[^1]: Cf. linking hypothesis; serial versus parallel processing debate

## Eye movements in reading

Human Visual System (recap):

-   **Fovea**: highest visual acuity
-   **Parafovea**: still partial recognition of objects
-   **Periphery**: blurred image

**Fixations** vs. **saccades**: movements (saccades) that place objects on the fovea for processing (fixations).

## Eye movements in reading

How does this work in reading?

-   A priori: Our eyes move, so that objects (words?) are placed on the fovea and can be processed.

...but this is not exactly so.

## Eye movements in reading

![From Conklin et al., 2018](images/session_3/perceptual_span_reading.JPG){fig-align="center" width="590"}

## Eye movements in reading

-   Fovea does not equate the perceptual span (= effective visual field)
-   Reading is asymmetric = asymmetric extraction of information
    -   Bias towards the direction of reading in the language
    -   English: 3-4[^2] letter spaces (1 degree of visual angle) to the left, 14-15 ls to the right

[^2]: Depends on print size, of course.

## Eye movements in reading

Fixations

-   Mean duration (silent reading in English): 200 - 250 ms
-   Lexical access initiated at about 100 ms (Sereno & Rayner, 2003)
-   Optimal Viewing Position
-   Affected by word length, frequency, predictability, etc.
- Most reading measures are based on fixation durations

![Data from Mariia Baltais](images/session_3/mariia_fix.JPG){fig-align="center" width="500"}

::: notes
The Optimal Viewing Position (OVP) effect shows that word identification is best when the eyes first fixate near the center of words. When words are presented for short durations, recognition performance is maximal when the viewing position is slightly left of the word center.
:::

## Eye movements in reading

Saccades

-   Saccadic supression
-   Mean size (silent reading in English): 7 to 9 letter spaces ($\pm$ 2 words before or after the fixated word)
    -   Size: distance travelled (amplitude)
- Not analyzed except for backward saccades (regressions)

![Data from Mariia Baltais](images/session_3/mariia_sac.JPG){fig-align="center" width="500"}

::: notes
Saccadic suppression refers to the behavioral observation that healthy humans under normal circumstances do not perceive this motion.
:::

## Eye movements in reading

Regressions

-   10-15% of the saccades are regressions to preceding areas
    -   Correct 'overshooting'
    -   Processing difficulty

![Data from Mariia Baltais](images/session_3/mariia_sac.JPG){fig-align="center" width="500"}

## Eye movements in reading

![](images/session_3/skipping.JPG){fig-align="center"}

## Eye movements in reading

Skipping

- 70% of the words in a text are fixated
- Content words are fixated 85% of the time, function words 35% of the time
- Predictors: word length; also predictability, frequency, etc.
    -   Parafoveal processing!
-   Overshooting or processing ease

## Eye movements in reading

Blinking

-   Noise
    -   Data pre-processing

![Data from Mariia Baltais](images/session_3/mariia_blink.JPG){fig-align="center" width="500"}

## Linking hypothesis

Fixations, regressions, skipping -\> wide range of measures.

Reading (during a fixation) entails the use of visual, orthographic, phonological, and morphological information to:

-   Identify a word
-   Activate its lexical representation
-   Integrate with the preceding context
- Predict what's next?

## Linking hypothesis

Just and Carpenter's (1980) eye-mind hypothesis (recap):

-   Where we look at = what we are processing

    -   Extends beyond linguistic processing (visual attention)

Just and Carpenter's (1980) immediacy hypothesis:

-   Readers try to interpret each content word as it is encountered

    -   As soon as possible, without delay

And, 

-   For how long we look = how difficult it is to process

::: notes
From J&C:

Gaze durations reflect the time to execute comprehension processes. Longer fixations are attributed to longer processing caused by the word's infrequency and its thematic importance.

The model of reading comprehension proposes that readers interpret a word while they are fixating it, and they continue to fixate it until they have processed it as far as they can.

The link between eye fixation data and the theory rests on two assumptions. One is the eye-mind assumption: **the eye remains fixated on a word as long as the word is being processed**. The eye-mind assumption posits that there is no appreciable lag between what is being fixated and what is being processed.

The immediacy assumption: a reader tries to interpret each content word of a text as it is encountered, even at the expense of making guesses that sometimes turn out to be wrong. The immediacy assumption posits that the interpretations at all levels of processing are not deferred; they occur as soon as possible.

The immediacy assumption posits that an attempt to relate each content word to its referent occurs as soon as possible. Sometimes this can be done when the word is first fixated, but sometimes more information is required. For example, although the semantic interpretation of a relative adjective like large can be computed immediately, the extensive meaning depends on the word it modifies (e.g., large insect vs. large building). The referent of the entire noun phrase can be computed only after both words are processed. The immediacy assumption does not state that the relating is done immediately on each content word, but rather that it occurs as soon as possible.

## Linking hypothesis

The more difficult the text...

-   The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the fixation durations
-   The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the saccade sizes
-   The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the regressions
-   The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the skipping of words

## Linking hypothesis

The more difficult the text...

-   The longer the fixation durations
-   The smaller the saccade sizes
-   The more frequent the regressions
-   The less frequent the skipping of words

## Linking hypothesis

- "Strong" eye-mind hypothesis: readers fixate a word until it's processed as far as possible

    -   Morrison, 1984: completion of lexical access on word *n* -\> immediate shift in attention & planning a saccade to word *n+1*

    -   Boland, 2004: the eyes do not leave a word until it has been *structurally* integrated

::: notes
Boland, 2004: The eyes do not leave a word until it has been structurally integrated. Therefore, **constraints that control structure-building influence first-pass reading time**.
:::

## Linking hypothesis

- Too strong? 

    -   Pickering et al. (2004): some aspects of processing take more time than the eye is “prepared to wait”

    -   Mitchell et al. (2008): regressions are not only linguistically supervised
    
::: notes
Pickering et al. (2004): some aspects of lexical, syntactic, and semantic processing do (largely) respect the immediacy and eye-mind assumptions (with some important caveats), but that **many aspects of sentence interpretation are somewhat delayed**. Semantic processing may not all occur “at once” (readers do look at difficult words such as Finland - in "A lot of Americans protested during Finland", - but they largely do this during later processing rather than during first pass).

Mitchell et al. (2008): the purpose of regressive fixations (and, indeed, re-fixations on the same word) is not to refresh the evidence but merely a delaying tactic used to provide "time out" for as-yet-incomplete parsing operations (to postpone new input).
:::

## Linking hypothesis

Asymmetrical perceptual span:

- **Preview benefit**: some info about *n+1* while still on *n* -\> shorter reading times *n+1*
    -   Lexical processing can start before a word is fixated
    
- **Parafoveal-on-foveal effects**: *n+1* characteristics influence reading times for *n*
    -   Cf. Table 4.1 in Conklin et al. (2018: 83)

## Linking hypothesis

As well as

- **Spillover effects**: *n* characteristics influence reading times for *n+1*
    -   Processing has not been completed

Therefore,

- Serial vs. parallel processing debate

    -   Different models of reading (E-Z Reader vs. SWIFT; OB1-Reader)

::: notes
Serial: words are processed one at a time in a linear sequence.

Parallel: words are processed simultaneously. The cognitive system processes information from several words at once, allowing for faster and more efficient reading.

The OB1-Reader model (upgrade of E-Z?) incorporates both serial and parallel processing components.

# Measures

## Measures

Fixations, regressions, and skipping form multiple reading measures that arguably tap into different cognitive processes.

-   **Global** vs. **local** measures
    -   Overall reading behaviour versus smaller units of text
-   Local measures: **early** (vs. intermediate) vs. **late** (see also Clifton et al., 2007).

## Measures

Reading measures \<\-\> specific cognitive events?
**Linking** depends on researchers' theoretical assumptions (Boland, 2004).

Traditionally,

-   **Early measures**: highly automatic word recognition and lexical access processes
- **Late measures**: more conscious, controlled, strategic processes

NB:

-   Different types of linguistic manipulations (e.g., lexical vs. syntactic) can produce effects in the same reading measure (e.g., gaze duration or total reading time).

## Early measures

First-pass measures.

-   First fixation duration, (single fixation duration), gaze duration: Time on an AI.
-   Skipping rate: % words that receive no fixation during 1st pass.
    -   Visual and linguistic factors e.g., parafoveal processing.
-   Factors known to affect: Frequency, familiarity, ambiguity, predictability, semantic association.

::: notes
1st fix: duration of the 1st fix on a word provided it isn't skipped. single fix dur: when there is only one fix gaze duration: sum of all fixations on a word prior to moving to another one (forward or backwards) skipping more likely due to linguistic factors but also processing it in the parafovea

earliest point for us to see an effect of a variable being manipulated
:::

## Early measures

::: {r-stack}
![](images/session_3/earlymeasures.jpg){fig-align="center" width="900"}
:::

-   First fixation duration: 3
-   Single fixation duration: NA (there are two fixations in the first pass)
-   Gaze duration: 3 + 4
-   Skipping rate: % trials where AI is skipped in first pass.

## Intermediate measures

-   Regression-path duration (or go-past time): time on N, N -1, etc. before N +1,
    -   Includes regressions out (1st pass regressions) and regressions in.

::: notes
hard to tell whether they show difficulty of encountering an item and the subsequent time taken to overcome the difficulty
:::

## Intermediate measures

::: {r-stack}
![](images/session_3/earlymeasures.jpg){fig-align="center" width="900"}
:::

-   Regression-path duration/go-past time: 3+4+5+6
-   Regressions-out (on first pass): %
-   Regressions-in: %

## Late measures

-   Total reading time: $\Sigma$ fix on N.
    -   Contextual and discourse-level factors + lexical (i.e., retrieval and integration).
-   Re-reading time (2nd pass reading time): Different definitions across the literature.
    -   General comprehension difficulties

## Late measures

::: {r-stack}
![](images/session_3/earlymeasures.jpg){fig-align="center" width="900"}
:::

-   Total reading time: 3+4+6+9
-   Re-reading time: 6+9 (total reading time - gaze duration)
-   Fixation count: 4

## Measures

Measures are dependent:

-   1st fixation duration - Gaze duration - Total reading time.
-   Late measures are cumulative.
-   Not total transparent mapping!

To reiterate...

# Paradigms in reading research

## Paradigms

Ecological validity.

-   Gaze-contigent paradigms: Eye gaze determines changes to the text display.
-   Reading of experimental stimuli.
-   Reading of natural text.

## Disappearing text paradigm

Liversedge et al., 2004

-   ROI: Disappears after an amount of time of fixation.
-   Shows: Fovea processing.
-   IV: Time to disappear \~ time for normal reading.
    -   Visual exposure for word recognition.

## Disappearing text paradigm

<br>

{{< video images/session_3/disappearing_text_animation.mp4>}}

## Fast priming paradigm

Sereno & Rayder, 1992

-   ROI: Target word is first a prime, then target word is presented after a fixation on it has occured for some time.
-   Shows: Prime facilitation
-   IV: Relationship prime and target.

## Fast priming paradigm

<br>

{{< video images/session_3/fast_priming_paradigm.mp4>}}

## Moving window paradigm

McConkie & Rayder, 1975

-   ROI: Mask around a fixation.
-   Shows: Parafoveal processing and perceptual span (extraction and use of information).
-   IV: Size of the window.

::: notes
By varying the size of the window and the type of mask (e.g., X's, visually similar or dissimilar characters) and comparing the reading times in the window and normal reading conditions, it is possible to define the size of the area from which a reader can efficiently extract and utilize information.
:::

## Moving window paradigm

<br>

{{< video images/session_3/moving_window.mp4>}}

## Foveal mask

Rayner & Bertera, 1979

-   ROI: Mask within the fixation
-   Shows: Parafoveal processing and perceptual span.
-   IV: Size of the window.

## Foveal mask

<br>

{{< video images/session_3/foveal_mask.mp4>}}

## Boundary paradigm

Rayder, 1975

Saccadic suppression.

-   ROI: Masked and then changed after fixations cross an invisible boundary.
-   Shows: Parafoveal processing and perceptual span (information extracted).
    -   Preview window effect.
    -   Parafoveal-on-foveal effect (e.g., Drieghe, 2011).
-   IV: What information is extracted e.g., visual similarity.

::: notes
The boundary paradigm (Rayner, 1975) makes use of the saccadic suppression. Saccadic suppression means that during a saccade the intake of visual information is suspended and the reader is practically blind. If a change in the visual environment is made during a saccade or very soon after the eyes have landed (\< 6 ms after the end of a saccade, McConkie & Loschky, 2002), the reader does not become consciously aware of it. The target word ("sentence" in the example of Table 7.1) is initially masked with a character string ("somkasoc"), and when the reader's eyes cross an invisible boundary in the text, the mask is replaced with the actual target word.

If the reader has extracted information from the target word preview prior to its change to the correct form, one should observe increased fixation time on the target word, even though the reader is not consciously aware of this. The size of the slowdown in eye fixation time, i.e. the difference between normal condition inwhich no change was made and a change condition is called the preview effect.

The preview benefit is simply computed as the difference in fixation time between a full preview condition, in which the target word was presented normally, and the preview condition.

Another measure to assess parafoveal processing is the so-called parafoveal-on-foveal effect (Kennedy, 2000). It measures the extent to which parafoveally available information affects fixation time on the previous word (Drieghe, 2011).

## Natural sentence reading (experimental stimuli)

Linguistic and non-linguistic factors affecting eye patterns in reading.

Usually, exploration of how movement patterns over a IA differ as a function of the properties of it.

Frazier & Rayner (1982)

## Natural text reading

GECO corpus (Cop et al., 2017)

-   The Mysterious Affair At Styles by Agatha Christie (1920)

![](images/session_3/geco.JPG)

Lack of control over text versus ecological validity.

-   Participants' characteristics + matching samples
    -   Additional questionnaires

# Single sentence reading experiment

## Single sentence reading experiment

Elements:

-   A sentence.

Trial sequence: Drift \> Visual Presentation

## Drift correction

Where the first word appears

![](images/lab_setup/drift_reading.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Visual Presentation

Visual presentation.

-   Time window of interest is from start to end (so no triggers in between).
    -   cf. gaze-contingent paradigms.

## Visual Presentation

Visual presentation: Areas of Interest

![](images/session_2/ia_reading.png)

## Areas of Interest

-   Target region but also
    -   Pre-critical region
    -   Spillover region

Research question.

-   Single words v phrases v clauses ...

## Areas of Interest

-   Never beginning/end of the line.
    -   1st and last fixations on a line are 5-7 ls from the edges.
    -   1st word likely to be skipped.
    -   1st fix longer, last fix shorter.
-   AI never clause-final.
    -   Wrap-up effect.

## Task

-   Move to the next trial
-   Comprehension (every now and then/every trial)

## Confounds

-   Characteristics of the visual presentation (non-linguistic).
-   Characteristics of the materials (linguistic)
-   Characteristics of the human visual system

## Non-linguistic confounds

Text layout:

-   Font style and size
    -   B&W for dyslexic participants is not good.
    -   Horizontal space.
    -   14-18 pt
    -   Monospace font (e.g., Courier)

## Non-linguistic confounds

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Line spacing
    -   Less accuracy for vertical movements
    -   Double/triple spacing.
-   Line breaks
-   Margins
    -   Accuracy is low at screen borders.

## Linguistic confounds

Same we have discussed in previous weeks (see Clifton et al., 2016):

-   The Big Three (Frequency, Length, Predictability)
-   Lexical ambiguity
-   Orthographic neighbourhood size (differ by 1 letter)
-   Prevalence
-   Inter alia

## HVS confounds

Foveal versus parafoveal processing.

-   Sequential nature of reading.

-   How information from one area can influence eye movements on the other.

    -   Predictability, length, etc.
    -   Parafoveal-on-foveal effects (see Hyönä, 2011).
    -   Serial versus parallel processing.
        -   Preview benefit, spillover effects.

-   Spillover: Effects of processing N are seen on N + 1, + 2.

-   Preview: Effects of perceiving N on N - 1.

    -   Match contexts!

## Exercise

Howard et al. (2017)

1.  How did they define the Areas of Interest?
2.  What factors should be considered for the antecedent? (i.e., hammer/plunger in the example)
3.  What information do you need from procedure and apparatus to replicate this study?
