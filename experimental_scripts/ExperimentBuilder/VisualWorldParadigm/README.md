This script was developed by Dr Esperanza Badaya under a Creative Commons license. Its original use is for the ugent-eyetracking repository.

This script is an adapted version of Allopena et al. (1998) VWP paradigm. The design is as follows:

There are four images on screen: the target, the cohort competitor, the rhyme competitor, and an unrelated item. Therefore, we have four areas of interest.
Preview window is of 1500 ms.
Participants listen to the instruction 'Click on the [target]'. Triggers are sent at images onset, sentence onset, noun onset, noun offset.
Participants' task is to click on the target with the mouse as soon as the recording has stopped.
In this demo, there are no filler trials.
Images were retrieved from the X database. Auditory stimuli was kindly recordeed by a British native speaker.
The trial conditions can be found in the file os_conditions.xlsx.
