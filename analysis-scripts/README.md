Here you can find mock data for the templates we have walked you through, so you can play around with them.

Additionally, you can find examples of code for how to analyse eye-tracking data (NB those have been developed by Esperanza Badaya and Mariia Baltais, so were you to use them for your own purposes, please give credit when appropriate).
    - These analyses are not done on the example data here provided, so visit their own repositories.
